# Breast Cancer Diagnostic Models

This repository contains machine learning models for breast cancer diagnosis. The models are built using Python and Jupyter Notebook, utilizing popular libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

## Dataset
The models are trained and evaluated on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which provides various features for predicting the diagnosis of breast cancer.

## Models
This repository includes two versions of the ML models:

- `shahabuddin_model_v1`: Implementing Algorithm X.
- `shahabuddin_model_v2`: Implementing Algorithm Y.

Each model is accompanied by a Jupyter Notebook file that demonstrates the entire process, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Usage
To run the models and reproduce the results:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_URL>`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file corresponding to the desired model version.
4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code step by step.
